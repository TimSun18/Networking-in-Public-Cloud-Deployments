1 Introduction
The purpose of this document is to state the requirements for Cloudia project of Company ABC (ABC). It is intended to provide the top-level requirements specification to enable the most appropriate solution to be determined.

Cloudia project will enable ABC to utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host company's web site.

1.1 Document Purpose
The Requirements Definition document captures what needs to be delivered to satisfy the needs of the project, identifying key criteria for the success of the project, phasing and criticality of solution components. This will influence subsequent phasing and delivery schedules of the project.

As such it achieves the following:

It provides visibility and exposure of stakeholder requirements for review
It documents the stakeholder team workshop responses, in terms of criticality, and provides a summary rating of each specification
It categorizes the requirements according to their functional block
It provides the level of detail necessary to effectively guide the selection of potential deployment solutions
It provides a basis for assessment of the network solution once implemented
1.2 Document Audience
The primary audience for this document consists of the ipspace team such areas as:

Instructors teams
Training attendees
This document is of primary importance and warrants input and acceptance from these teams.

1.3 Document Scope
This Requirements Definition focuses on the identification and recommendation of solution requirements for the Cloudia project.

1.4 Inclusions
The following general areas are considered in scope within this document:

Functional requirements
Non-functional requirements
1.5 Exclusion
The following areas are specifically out of scope of this document:

Enterprise solution architecture, including high level network design or architectural discussion
Information Security strategy, including procedure or design
Detailed design of the physical layer or network specifics
Implementation or activation planning
Migration strategy
1.1 Presentation Format
The project requirements will be presented in tables with the following format:

Identifier	Description	Classification	Priority
R.Example.1	The System MUST have requirements.	Mandatory	1
R.Example.2	The System MAY have 40 requirements.	Desirable	3
Table 1 – Presentation Format

Where:

Identifier is a unique identifier for the requirement, allowing the requirements to be explicitly referenced in other documents
Description is a prose description of the requirement. It should be specific and verifiable and use terms detailed in Section 1.6.1 - Nomenclature.
Classification defines the importance of fulfilling the requirement in terms of solution appropriateness. The order of importance is Optional, Desirable and Mandatory
Priority is referenced where time constraints are imposed on the delivery of the program of works. Critical path requirements or components will be delivered before non-critical components
1. 1.1.1 Nomenclature
The following statements have specific meaning when detailing requirements:

Term	Description
MUST	Requirements described using the word MUST are mandatory items. Failing to satisfy these requirements will result in a system that does not fulfil its ultimate purpose.These requirements will have a classification of M, or Mandatory.E.g.: The car MUST have seatbelts.
MUST NOT	Requirements described using the phrase MUST NOT are mandatory items. Failing to satisfy these requirements will result in a system that does not fulfil its ultimate purpose. This is the opposite of MUST.These requirements will have a classification of M, or Mandatory.E.g.: The car MUST NOT explode when driven at 60 kph.
SHOULD	Requirements described using the word SHOULD are desirable items. Failing to satisfy these requirements will result in a system that lacks certain features but will still fulfil its ultimate purpose.These requirements will have a classification of D, or Desirable.E.g.: The car SHOULD have air-conditioning.
SHOULD NOT	Requirements described using the phrase SHOULD NOT are desirable items. Failing to satisfy these requirements will result in a system that has certain undesirable features but will still fulfil its ultimate purpose. This is the opposite of SHOULD.These requirements will have a classification of D, or Desirable.E.g.: The car SHOULD NOT be blue.
MAY	Requirements described using the word MAY are optional items. Failing to satisfy these requirements will result in a system that fulfils the majority of its purpose but lacks certain 'nice to have' features.These requirements will have a classification of O, or Optional.E.g.: The car MAY have GPS navigation.
MAY NOT	Requirements described using the phrase MAY NOT are optional items. Failing to satisfy these requirements will result in a system that fulfils the majority of its purpose but lacks certain 'nice to have' features. This phrase is also used to capture items that were discussed but evaluated as unnecessary.These requirements will have a classification of O, or Optional.E.g.: The car MAY NOT be red.
